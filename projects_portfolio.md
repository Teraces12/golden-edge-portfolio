1. **Enhancing Autonomous Systems with Bayesian Neural Networks: A Probabilistic Framework for Navigation and Decision-Making**  
   Lebede Ngartera, Saralees Nadarajah  
   *Frontiers in Built Environment* (Published on 08 May 2025)

2. **Hybrid Naïve Bayes Models for Scam Detection: Comparative Insights From Email and Financial Fraud**  
   Lebede Ngartera, Mahamat Ali Issaka, Saralees Nadarajah  
   *IEEE Access* (Published on 01 Jan 2025)  
   **Abstract**: Online scams continue to escalate in scale and sophistication, ranging from deceptive phishing emails to complex financial fraud schemes. These evolving threats have surpassed the capabilities of traditional detection systems, creating an urgent demand for scalable, real-time, and interpretable machine learning solutions. This study revisits the Naïve Bayes algorithm—often underestimated in modern cybersecurity—as a core building block for effective scam detection. By examining two specific case studies on phishing emails and financial fraud detection, we explore the mathematical foundations of Naïve Bayes and address its limitations, such as the assumption of feature independence, challenges with high-dimensional data, and extreme class imbalance. We apply advanced feature engineering techniques and introduce hybrid model architectures that integrate Naïve Bayes with deep learning and ensemble methods. Our empirical results reveal that a strategically optimized Naïve Bayes model can deliver competitive accuracy, while maintaining transparency and computational efficiency—key attributes for real-world fraud prevention systems. By bridging theory and application, this research challenges the notion that simplicity implies ineffectiveness. It demonstrates that Naïve Bayes, particularly when hybridized, remains a powerful and adaptable tool in the fight against evolving cyber threats, contributing to the design of robust and responsive cybersecurity frameworks.

3. **Application of Bayesian Neural Networks in Healthcare: Three Case Studies**  
   Lebede Ngartera, Mahamat Ali Issaka, Saralees Nadarajah  
   *Machine Learning and Knowledge Extraction* (Published on 16 Nov 2024)  
   **Abstract**: This study aims to explore the efficacy of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) in enhancing predictive modeling for healthcare applications. Advancements in artificial intelligence have significantly improved predictive modeling capabilities, with BNNs offering a probabilistic framework that addresses the inherent uncertainty and variability in healthcare data. This study demonstrates the real-world applicability of BNNs through three key case studies: personalized diabetes treatment, early Alzheimer's disease detection, and predictive modeling for HbA1c levels. By leveraging the Bayesian approach, these models provide not only enhanced predictive accuracy but also uncertainty quantification, a critical factor in clinical decision making. While the findings are promising, future research should focus on optimizing scalability and integration for real-world applications. This work lays a foundation for future studies, including the development of rating scales based on BNN predictions to improve clinical outcomes.

4. **A Comparative Study of Optimization Techniques on the Rosenbrock Function**  
   Lebede Ngartera, Diallo Coumba  
   *Open Journal of Optimization* (Published on 12 Oct 2024)  
   **Abstract**: In the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the choice of optimization algorithm can significantly impact the success of model training and the accuracy of predictions. This paper embarks on a rigorous and comprehensive exploration of widely adopted optimization techniques, specifically focusing on their performance when applied to the notoriously challenging Rosenbrock function. As a benchmark problem known for its deceptive curvature and narrow valleys, the Rosenbrock function provides a fertile ground for examining the nuances and intricacies of algorithmic behavior. The study delves into a diverse array of optimization methods, including traditional Gradient Descent, its stochastic variant (SGD), and the more sophisticated Gradient Descent with Momentum. The investigation further extends to adaptive methods like RMSprop, AdaGrad, and the highly regarded Adam optimizer. By meticulously analyzing and visualizing the optimization paths, convergence rates, and gradient norms, this paper uncovers critical insights into the strengths and limitations of each technique. Our findings not only illuminate the intricate dynamics of these algorithms but also offer actionable guidance for their deployment in complex, real-world optimization problems. This comparative analysis promises to intrigue and inspire researchers and practitioners alike, as it reveals the subtle yet profound impacts of algorithmic choices in the quest for optimization excellence.

5. **Advancements and Applications of the Adomian Decomposition Method in Solving Nonlinear Differential Equations**  
   Lebede Ngartera, Yaya Moussa  
   *Journal of Mathematics Research* (Published on 31 Aug 2024)  
   **Abstract**: The Adomian Decomposition Method (ADM), introduced by George Adomian in the 1980s, stands out as a revolutionary technique for solving linear and nonlinear differential equations. ADM's compelling simplicity and remarkable computational efficiency have propelled its adoption across diverse scientific and engineering disciplines. This paper offers an in-depth exploration of ADM, delving into its robust theoretical foundations and versatile practical applications. By presenting detailed examples, we showcase ADM's adaptability and efficacy in addressing complex challenges. We highlight significant advancements that have enhanced the method's capabilities, tackling contemporary obstacles and unveiling innovative solutions. Through meticulous simulations and real-world case studies, we demonstrate ADM's exceptional prowess in optimizing renewable energy systems, modeling turbulent flows, and analyzing structural dynamics under seismic forces. Our findings underscore ADM's critical role in advancing computational approaches for differential equations, emphasizing its practical advantages. This comprehensive evaluation not only attests to the current effectiveness of ADM but also charts future research pathways poised to make substantial contributions to applied mathematics and engineering.
